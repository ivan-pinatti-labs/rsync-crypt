"""Turn kcov's Cobertura report into SonarQube's generic coverage format.

kcov measures which lines of a shell script ran, and writes Cobertura XML.
SonarQube Cloud has no importer of its own for shell coverage, but it does
accept its generic coverage format for any file it analyzes, so this
rewrites one into the other.

It also holds the shell to 100%: every script named on the command line has
to appear in the report with every line covered. kcov has no threshold of
its own, and it leaves a script that never ran out of its report entirely,
so a script nobody tested would otherwise read as nothing to cover.

Usage: kcov-to-sonar.py <root> <cobertura.xml> <output.xml> <script> [<script> ...]

<root> is where the repository was when kcov ran. Each script is a path
relative to it, the path SonarQube knows the file by. Run by the Makefile's
`coverage` target.
